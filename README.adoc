"Sui Sin Far (Chinese: 水仙花; pinyin: Shuǐ Xiān Huā, born Edith Maude Eaton; 15 March 1865 – 7 April 1914) was an author known for her writing about Chinese people in North America and the Chinese American experience. "Sui Sin Far", the pen name under which most of her work was published, is the Cantonese name of the narcissus flower, popular amongst Chinese people."

New works and formats will be added here as they become available.

== Purpose of the project

The writings of Sui Sin Far are surprisingly difficult to find in one place, considering that they are all in now in the public domain. The works that are available are often stored in cumbersome formats that make them inconvenient to read or repurpose -- for example, they may comprise several pages in the middle of a 300 page, 118 Mb scanned PDF in the Internet Archive, or in non-semantic HTML format scattered across various different university websites and personal homepages.

The goals of this project are:

. To provide a curated collection of known works by Sui Sin Far together in one place
. To store the content in semantic Asciidoctor format, preserving information useful for both human readers and machines
. To provide a number of generated derivative formats from the Asciidoctor texts to demonstrate the flexibility and resilience of this approach
. To maintain a database of annotations to the texts to enhance the reading experience for modern readers and enable rich (and perhaps eventually interactive) annotation in generated formats
. To allow scholars, readers, and others to easily correct, annotate, and improve the texts
. To explore different possibilities for the way that digital humanities texts are stored, encoded, presented, and transformed
. To provide all of the tools needed to create the derivative file formats, with the aim of creating _reproducible builds_ of the semantic Asciidoctor text content.

== Formats

Examples of available generated formats include:

* Rich and responsive HTML5, carefully optimized for readability on a variety of screen and device sizes, based on the design work of Edward Tufte
* Clean, readable PDFs generated by Asciidoctor PDF
* Booklet-style printable PDFs, designed to be printed on any printer and folded together (no staples required)
* Epubs, designed to be viewed on an ebook reader
* MOBI, for use on Amazon Kindle devices
* DocBook (planned), for conversion to XML and print book publication
